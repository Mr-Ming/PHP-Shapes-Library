## Features
Each of these shapes provides:
1. getArea() for calculating Area
2. getPerimeter() for calculating Perimeter
3. resize($percentage) for resizing
4. Getters for getting base / height / radius / side (whichever one is applicable depending on shape)
5. Setters for setting base / height / radius / side (whichever one is applicable depending on shape)

Additionally, there is a shapeInterface that governs the required method that needs to be implemented if new shape are added
